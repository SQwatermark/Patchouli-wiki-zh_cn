# 事先准备

This page covers knowledge and tools you must have in order to be effective at authoring
content with Patchouli. All later documentation on this site will assume you have
these tools at hand and this knowledge in mind.

## Tools

### Text Editor
A competent text editor such as Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, vim, or emacs is a must.
Do *not* use software such as notepad, WordPad, Word, or Pages.
Preferably, your editor should have highlighting support for JSON, which will save you
from common typos that are made when working with the format.

## Knowledge

### JSON
You should know the basics of the JSON data format, including the core data types and syntax.
The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Syntax) provides a good overview.

### Namespaced ID's
Namespaced ID's are how Minecraft gives things unique names. Please read the [vanilla wiki
page](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_location) on the subject carefully.

### Pack Layout
You should have a basic understanding of how resource packs and data packs are laid out,
from the root folder to the `/assets/` and `/data/` directories. The corresponding vanilla
wiki pages have more information about this for [resource
packs](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_Pack#Folder_structure) and [data
packs](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_Pack#Folder_structure) respectively.
