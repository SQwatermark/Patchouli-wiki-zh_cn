Hi there. This is a new website we're building out for Patchouli documentation. The old
GitHub wiki was workable, but it was hard to edit locally and the organization was quite
poor.

Currently, we've imported all the documentation verbatim from GitHub, but over the next
few weeks we'll be cleaning things up and properly separating the "guides" from the
"reference material".

Enjoy!
